LLMs - Large Language Model - AI model trained on massive amounts of text data which is available over the internet to understand and generate human-like language.

    gpt-4o, gpt-5o, gpt-3.5-turbo

> It can read, write, summarize, translate, answer questions and even reason - all in natural language.


    Large - Refers to huge no of parameters (millions or billions) that the model learns during training.

        Eg. GPT-4 has over 1 trillon parameters


    Language:

        It's designed to work with human language - Python 

    Model:

        It is a mathematical system trained to predict next word in a sequence.
